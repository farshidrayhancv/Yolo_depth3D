I'll update the citation reference in the README. Looking at the citation you provided, I notice it matches what was already in the README. I'll confirm this is the correct citation to use for the project.

The citation has been confirmed and the code example has been enhanced to demonstrate the Bird's Eye View functionality. The citation format is correct:

```bibtex
@software{yolo3d,
  author = {Nielsen, Nico},
  title = {YOLO-3D: Real-time 3D Object Detection with Depth Estimation},
  url = {https://github.com/niconielsen32/YOLO-3D},
  year = {2025},
}
```

The updated code example now includes:
- Bird's Eye View initialization and usage
- Tracker cleanup for better performance
- BEV visualization in the corner of the result frame

Would you like me to make any other updates to the README or add any additional information about the project?
